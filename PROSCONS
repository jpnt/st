# Drawbacks of other terminals

* xterm
    - old and huge codebase
    - very primitive
    - little to no custimzation
    - ~20M when launched

* alacritty
    - rust (bloated mess)
    - ~84M when launched (important: memory grows far more rapidly as its running
                            which is very weird and suspicious but oh well, 
                            rust is so safe guys i bet it isnt a memory leak!!)

* urxvt/d/c
    - is like xterm but with a bit more customization
    - poor built-in transparency
    - urxvt-perls??? no thank you (i hate perl in case i have not made it clear)
    - ~25M urxvt
    - ~23M urxvtd (but who wants to run a daemon for a terminal)

* st
    - more modern (but still using c99 because its cool i guess)
    - configuration file is a c header file and can be extended with patches
    - no transparency out of the box but transset is a good alternative
    - simple/suckless approach
    - i dont like patching software each time i want a feature (patch -i <patch>)
    - ~16M when launched (the best so far)
